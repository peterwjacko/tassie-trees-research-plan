# Aim and objectives

The overarching aim of this project is to develop advanced approaches to automated vegetation mapping by combining remote sensing and deep learning technologies. This research will investigate the accuracy, applicability, accessibility, and scalability of these technologies using Tasmania’s vulnerable vegetation communities as a case study.

To achieve this aim, we will focus on the following objectives:

1. Investigate the role of hyperspectral information for dense prediction tasks of native vegetation target classes in complex forest canopies by comparing the performance of deep neural network architectures that capture the spatial-spectral relationships in the data with architectures that only consider the spatial relationships.
2. Objective 2: on model generalisation and knowledge distillation
3. Objective 3: on DNNs using ecological context and how they exploit ecological patterns
4. Objective 4: on using RS-derived tree inventories to inform better conservation outcomes
