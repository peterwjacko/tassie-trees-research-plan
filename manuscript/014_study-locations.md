# Study area

The proposed study areas ([](#proposed-study-sites)) are concentrated along the west and southwest coasts of Tasmania, encompassing known habitats of the target endemic species. Study site selection was guided by occurrence records from the Atlas of Living Australia [@AtlasLivingAustralia2025], vegetation mapping data from TASVEG 4.0 [@departmentofnaturalresourcesandenvironmenttasmaniaTASVEG402020], and consultation with local botanical experts. Several sites contain documented populations of target species but lack detailed, contemporary mapping products.

Drought conditions over the 2024/25 summer led to series of bushfires initiated by dry lightning strikes in February of 2025. One of these fires burned within proximity to a known Huon Pine population along the Wilson and Harman rivers. This presented us with a unique opportunity to acquire remote sensing data of a marginal population immediately post-fire. As a result, we planned three study sites along the Stanley River, Harman River, and Wilson River ([](#proposed-study-sites): Study Area 1, 2, and 3).

Data acquisition was completed for these three southern Tarkine sites as of April 2025. Additionally, data acquisition for the Davey River site ([](#proposed-study-sites): Study Area 13) was completed in February 2023 using a sensor configuration consistent with this project.
