# Problem statement

Tasmania's endemic species face unprecedented threats from climate change and altered fire regimes, yet current mapping approaches are inadequate for conservation planning [@gallagherGlobalShortfallsThreat2023]. Existing methods rely on infrequent aerial photo interpretation that produces coarse, community-level classifications decades apart, providing no information on species-level distributions, population condition, or change detection [@departmentofnaturalresourcesandenvironmenttasmaniaTASVEG402020]. This temporal and spatial resolution mismatch prevents adaptive management responses to rapidly changing environmental conditions.

Deep learning approaches show promise for automated species-level discrimination using remote sensing data, but critical knowledge gaps limit operational application. Most studies focus on classification accuracy rather than understanding which spectral features enable species discrimination, particularly for hyperspectral data. Additionally, the scalability challenge remains unresolvedâ€”how to transfer knowledge from high-resolution research datasets to operational monitoring systems using readily available satellite imagery.

Current multi-modal integration approaches employ simple data stacking rather than sophisticated fusion architectures that could leverage complementary spectral, structural, and environmental information streams [@zhongReviewTreeSpecies2024]. The integration of ecological theory and landscape context into deep learning models remains largely unexplored, despite potential for improving both accuracy and ecological realism of species predictions.

This research addresses these gaps by developing hyperspectral deep learning approaches for endemic species mapping, investigating knowledge transfer techniques for operational scalability, and demonstrating integration with conservation planning frameworks. The focus on Tasmania's endemic species provides a critical test case for global paleoendemism conservation while advancing methodological approaches applicable worldwide.
